                                  you start reading through them, I want you to understand something first. The main
                                  purpose of the skills I described here are for you to be able to have an idea of what
                                  kind of person I am and if I fit your working environment. If you read
                                  <a href="About_Myself.html" >About Myself</a>
                                  page, you should've understood that I am a person capable enough and even if I am put
                                  in a new environment, with enough training and time, I can improve and benefit you and
                                  your company on the long run.

                                     trust those, I found them to be an easier way to create an image about what kind of
                                     person I am. That's all I have to say, on you go then.

                <p class="sk-sec3-11 ss-ctn target-1">I hate being late, be it arriving somewhere or finishing a project,
                                                      I always make sure I have enough time left before the deadline.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-12 ss-ctn target-1">My aim is to live a long life and one of those obstacles that I
                                                      have to deal every day is stress. I know when I am about to get
                                                      stressed and do my best to avoid it. If I can't avoid it, I do
                                                      everything I can to mitigate the impact it will have on my body
                                                      and mind.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-13 ss-ctn target-1">The only time when I am not organised is when I end up in the zone.
                                                      I am too focused to care about my surroundings and dedicate
                                                      everything I have to what's in front of me.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-14 ss-ctn target-1">An essential ability that increases efficiency and reduces stress.
                                                      To be able to reduce stress even more, I learnt how to prioritise
                                                      my problems, thus, I can have easier time dealing with them.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-15 ss-ctn target-1">Who doesn't plan? <br> But before I plan I usually try to find as
                                                      much information as I can. I typically stop after I found enough to
                                                      satisfy my needs and help me formulate a decent plan. After that I
                                                      focus on smaller parts of the plan and search for more information
                                                      to be able to fully define that part.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="sk-sec3-21 ss-ctn target-2">I have seen many instances where the lack of communication brought
                                                      many unwanted events. I know very well how important it is.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-22 ss-ctn target-2">Although I don't go around looking to have a chat with someone,
                                                      I am confident that I can have a proper and concise conversation,
			                                          whether if I am knowledgeable in the field or not.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-23 ss-ctn target-2">I've got experience only in writing reports and emails.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-24 ss-ctn target-2">It became a second nature to me. I have been subjected to
                                                      destructive feedback most of my life and because of that I decided
                                                      to never make such a stupid mistake.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-25 ss-ctn target-2">I think this is one of the skills I am most confident in. If you
                                                      want to see me put it in practice, just contact me and let's have

                </div>
                <p class="sk-sec3-31 ss-ctn target-3">Immediately after I graduated from high school, I moved to UK to study
                                                      at the University of Aberdeen. I had to adapt to new culture, new
                                                      language, new environment. The fact that I finished the university
                                                      degree with honours, should be proof enough of my ability to adapt.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-32 ss-ctn target-3">Getting where I am today, pushing myself without external help to
                                                      learn different languages and applications to create my portfolio
                                                      and this website, requires not only motivation but also a certain
                                                      amount of proper self-management. Otherwise, I would never have
                                                      finished what I started.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-33 ss-ctn target-3">If I wasn't optimistic, I would have never built this website and
                                                      my portfolio in the first place.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-34 ss-ctn target-3">The interesting part of this skill, is that it aggravates those
                                                      around me, especially in stressful situations. It's funny!</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-35 ss-ctn target-3">Born from curiosity and developed into a proper skill. I've tried
                                                      both sides of the coin and can also do objective analysis.</p>

                <p class="sk-sec3-41 ss-ctn target-4">I like challenges, but not all challenges are worth it. I like
                                                      them not only due to the increase in difficulty, nor the
                                                      application of knowledge, but mostly because of the creativity one
                                                      can come up while solving these problems.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-42 ss-ctn target-4">I hate Emotional Reasoning. It's not only irrational and not backed
                                                      up by facts, but it also aids to development of delusions. </p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-43 ss-ctn target-4">I don't know if this skill is innate or developed at high speed as
                                                      I grew, but since I remember, my critical observational skills were
                                                      better than those around me.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-44 ss-ctn target-4">I have participated only in two brainstorming sessions in my life.
                                                      It is fun and interesting at the same time where these sessions can
                                                      get you.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-45 ss-ctn target-4">I can make hard decisions, I am not weak-willed, nor am I afraid
                                                      of taking responsibility, but if I can avoid it, I would rather
		                                              leave it to someone else. This is mostly because it helps me avoid
                                                      any unnecessary stress. </p>

                                                      to be in conflict with me. Solving others conflicts is more of
                                                      clearing misunderstandings and miscommunication cases.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-52 ss-ctn target-5">I have been part of multiple teams during my studies at university
                                                      and saw the pros and cons of teamwork.</p>

                                                      and increases the work efficiency.</p>

                                                      but to coordinate my department with other departments. </p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-55 ss-ctn target-5">I am an open-minded person, but pretty grounded too. If it's just
                                                      talking about hypothetical things, then things can get really

                                                      know, I can share some with you.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-62 ss-ctn target-6">I can share some of my writings if you want to see how good is my
                                                      imagination.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-63 ss-ctn target-6">To be honest, I never expected such a skill existed before I
                                                      happened to find it on internet. After finding out how complex of
                                                      a skill it is, I realised that I have been applying it to my
                                                      day-to-day life unconsciously. </p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-64 ss-ctn target-6">This skill is like a drug to me when I do it out of curiosity, it
                                                      never tires me out. I also like it when I use it to test stuff.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-65 ss-ctn target-6">An important skill that I developed to avoid missing anything that
                                                      may be important, especially when trying to avoid stress.</p>

                <p class="sk-sec3-71 ss-ctn target-7">I can take the lead if no one is willing to, someone had to, but
                                                      if it's not necessary, I would rather leave it to others to avoid
                                                      the stress that comes with the position.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-72 ss-ctn target-7">Oh, I like this skill. It is something that I have cultivated with
                                                      great effort for more than 5 years. I tell you, the stress relief
                                                      you get from it is something else. </p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-73 ss-ctn target-7">I have never been a mentor. The closest thing that I did to
                                                      mentoring was tutoring, but that's not even close to it. </p>

                                                      especially if they happen to reduce stress.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="sk-sec3-91 ss-ctn target-9">I started developing this skill when I was trying to draw as a
                                                      hobby. The more I learnt about drawing techniques and certain rules
		                                              the more I got absorbed in it and tried to enhance the details. Since
                                                      then, I have been applying this skill unconsciously. I am walking
                                                      a tight rope when it comes to this skill as I sometimes fall in
                                                      focusing too much on perfecting the details. Don't worry,I am making
                                                      a conscious effort in maintaining the balance.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-92 ss-ctn target-9">One important factor I take into account when using this skill is
                                                      giving me enough time as a buffer to cover any unexpected situation
                                                      that might appear.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-93 ss-ctn target-9">I always engage this skill after an important situation. It helped
                                                      me grow my willpower and emotional intelligence above the average
                                                      level. At least I believe it is above the average level.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-94 ss-ctn target-9">This skill has helped me more times than I can count. Actually is
                                                      one of the skills I always count on.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-95 ss-ctn target-9">Through the introspection and critical thinking I've been using for
                                                      such a long time, I have discovered most of my limits, what I can
                                                      do and don't. That's why I am confident, not arrogant.</p>

                                                        skill is through my punctuality and teamwork.</p>

                                                        but the more people I interacted with, the more this skill
                                                        developed and become a part of me.</p>
                <p class="sk-sec3-104 ss-ctn target-10">I believe this skill derived from Dependability. Anyway, I

                                                        but when it comes to deal with something (e.g. projects) it
                                                        depends on the situation.</p>

                                                        and didn't jump straight to this one, you should have already
                                                        made an idea if I have good work ethic or not.</p>

                                        you don't want to go through all of them, just check out the 5th survey.
                                        Personally though, I find that what the rest of the surveys mention is also
